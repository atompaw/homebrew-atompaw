# Homebrew tap for ATOMPAW

This is a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) for the [AtomPAW](https://www.abinit.org) code.

## Installing

Install Homebrew and run:

```
brew tap atompaw/repo
brew install atompaw
```

or directly:

```
brew install atompaw/repo/atompaw
```

*Notes:*

- *Always use the latest Homebrew version (use* `brew upgrade`*).*
- *Bottles for `Mac Silicon` (arm64) are not always provided. If so, atompaw will be built on the fly during installation process. The build only takes 2' on a Macbook M1 (2020).*
